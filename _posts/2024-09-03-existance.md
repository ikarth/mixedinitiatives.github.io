I've been thinking more about the ideas I wrote about in
[designing the generative dimension](https://cohost.org/procgen/post/5518465-designing-the-genera/93937186d5094a71bae6ebc839728dec) and [walking through the generative dimension](https://cohost.org/procgen/post/5860712-walking-through-the). One of the major things I'm interested in is the shape of this space of possible things: every rule system describes a space of existance, in opposition to the void of non-existance. 

Which is basically a bunch of big words to say that some things are possible and some things are not, but I think a lot of the rhetoric of procedural generation--and generative processes more broadly--still misses this point. Practitioners are less likely to make this mistake, of course. I've been excited about the academic discussion on information theory, [Kolmogorov Complexity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.02131), and [Dearth of the Author](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10289), for example. But I think that it's worth thinking about how generative design is often about making choices about what _should_ be left out.
