-. Give me a takeaway from Papert about software instruments.

Students are often introduced to imperative programming using the Logo language introduced by Papert, which provides a software instrument called a 'turtle'.

A turtle carries a pen, which traces its movement on the canvas. The turtle can be directed to move forward, or to turn by a certain amount, and to repeat a block of such instructions a given number of times.

It turns out that many remarkable figures can be produced by stringing together these instructions and varying their parameterization. Logo is a prototypical example of a 'generative system'.


-. Tell me why Papert isn't talking about cybernetic systems.

A cybernetic system contains a set of subjects, and a set of arcs of interaction between subjects. For example, a programmer and their Logo environment together comprise a cybernetic system.

The Logo environment converts a sequence of instructions into a turtle-made drawing on the screen. The programmer converts this drawing into a modified set of instructions, because they are trying to make or discover another form. This execution-evaluation loop (per Norman) comprises an exploration of the artifact space (see Compton on expressive range) of Logo.

All instruments participate in an execution-evaluation loop, which necessarily involves a human - especially software instruments, e.g. Logo. Most cybernetic analyses of artifact spaces post-date (and draw upon) Papert's work on Mindstorms, as well as Sutherland's work on Sketchpad.


-. What is a performance? What is a score?

A (cybernetic) performance comprises of an inner 'practice' loop, involving the player and their instrument, and an outer 'presentation' loop, involving the practice and its audience. 

Performances may be improvised, or based on a score.

'Practices' derive from improvisation and scores in the same way. For example, Logo is practiced (as an instrument) by refining a score (a sequence of instructions) until the turtle does the right thing, or something else interesting.


-. Why does Raley use performance to talk about cybernetic systems?




-. How does Short approach one characterization of the generative meta-medium?
